# Arcane Empires: Database Modules

This repository contains the modularized database components for the Arcane Empires project. The modules are designed to handle various aspects of the game, including player data, market operations, trade history, global state, and faction war outcomes. This modular approach facilitates easier maintenance, scalability, and future expansion.

## Overview

The project has been split into the following database modules:

- **Players Data:** Manages player-specific information.
- **Market Data:** Handles stock market operations.
- **Trade History:** Records trade activities and market trends.
- **Global State:** Maintains the global economy state (e.g., AI status).
- **Faction War:** Tracks outcomes of faction-based conflicts.

A central initializer (`init_db.py`) is provided to set up and initialize all the tables within the SQLite database.

## File Structure

.
├── init_db.py
└── database_modules
├── players_db.py
├── market_db.py
├── trade_history_db.py
├── global_state_db.py
└── faction_war_db.py

- **init_db.py:** Central file that imports and calls the initialization functions from each module to set up the database.
- **database_modules/players_db.py:** Contains functions to create and manage the `players` table.
- **database_modules/market_db.py:** Contains functions to create and manage the `market` table.
- **database_modules/trade_history_db.py:** Contains functions to create and manage the `trade_history` table, including functionality to add trade records.
- **database_modules/global_state_db.py:** Contains functions to create and manage the `global_state` table.
- **database_modules/faction_war_db.py:** Contains functions to create and manage the `faction_war` table.

## How to Use

1. **Initialize the Database:**

   Run the `init_db.py` script to initialize all database tables. This script creates or updates the SQLite database (`observer_protocol.db`) with all necessary tables.

   ```bash
   python init_db.py

	2.	Adding Trade Records:
To add a trade record, import and call the add_trade function from the trade_history_db.py module:

from database_modules.trade_history_db import add_trade

# Example usage:
add_trade(player_id=1, stock="Arcane Corp", amount=500)


	3.	Integrating with Your Application:
Each module is designed to be self-contained. Import the required functions from these modules in your game backend as needed. This modular structure helps maintain clarity and separation of concerns.

Additional Notes
	•	Modularity: This structure allows for easy expansion. As new game features are developed, additional modules can be added without affecting existing functionality.
	•	SQLite: The project uses SQLite. Ensure you have the sqlite3 module available in your Python environment.
	•	Future Development: Use this structure as a baseline for further improvements and additional database functionality as the project evolves.
