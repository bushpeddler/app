# **Observer Protocol: Persistent Player Wealth & Financial Legacies**

## **Overview**
In *Arcane Empires*, wealth is more than just a number—it’s a **legacy.** Instead of resetting completely between cycles, **some financial influence, assets, and reputations persist** into future economies.

This document outlines:
- **How player wealth is transferred across resets**
- **Intergenerational financial dynasties & legacy banking**
- **Wealth erosion & economic decay mechanics**
- **How player decisions affect long-term financial influence**
- **Faction-driven wealth redistribution vs. monopolization**

---

## **1. Wealth Transfer Mechanics: What Carries Over?**
After **each economic cycle ends**, certain **financial elements persist**, creating **long-term strategic advantages**.

### **A. What Players Keep vs. Lose**
| **Wealth Category** | **Fully Reset?** | **Partial Transfer?** | **Fully Retained?** |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Cash Reserves** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Real Estate & Infrastructure** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Bank Accounts (Trust Funds, Vaults, Offshore Accounts)** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Stock Portfolios & Digital Assets** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Economic Reputation & Influence** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Faction Ties & Trade Agreements** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

- **Liquid wealth (cash, coins) resets**, ensuring no **permanent hyper-rich elite.**
- **Real estate, trust funds, and stocks retain partial value**, simulating **multi-generational wealth.**
- **Player reputations and influence remain**, impacting **faction interactions and trade access.**

---

## **2. Economic Decay & Wealth Erosion**
To prevent **infinite wealth accumulation**, *Arcane Empires* introduces **economic decay mechanics.**

### **A. The "Wealth Attrition" System**
- **Unspent wealth deteriorates over time** (inflation, devaluation, taxation).
- **Hoarded assets may be taxed, stolen, or devalued** in new cycles.
- **Stored wealth must be reinvested** to remain **useful in future economies.**

| **Wealth Status** | **Decay Rate Per Cycle** |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Liquid Currency** | -50% per reset |
| **Banked Investments** | -20% per reset |
| **Physical Assets (Properties, Trade Hubs)** | -10% per reset |
| **Faction-Based Wealth** | Retains value if **faction is still in power** |

---

## **3. Intergenerational Wealth & Financial Dynasties**
Players can **pass wealth and reputation** across game resets, simulating **economic dynasties.**

### **A. Legacy Banking System**
- Players can **create financial trusts**, allowing **partial wealth inheritance.**
- Dynasties are **recognized by factions**, granting **special trade privileges**.
- If a dynasty **grows too powerful**, rival factions **may try to dismantle it.**

| **Dynasty Tier** | **Bonus in New Cycle** | **Risk Factor** |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| **New Wealth** | Small financial inheritance | Low |
| **Established Family** | Trade discounts, stock market access | Medium |
| **Economic Empire** | Global influence, permanent assets | High |

---

## **4. Factional Wealth Redistribution vs. Monopolization**
Factions **react differently** to **persistent player wealth**.

### **A. How Factions Handle Long-Term Player Influence**
| **Faction** | **Stance on Wealth Retention** | **Policy** |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Syndicate** | Protects **elite financial circles** | High-level traders keep **full wealth control**. |
| **Technocrats** | Limits wealth hoarding | Forces AI-led **economic equalization**. |
| **Decentralists** | Wealth fluctuates freely | No restrictions—**survival of the richest.** |

---

## **5. Endgame Wealth Persistence Scenarios**
Depending on **how the economy evolves**, wealth **persists in different ways**.

| **Final Economic State** | **Wealth Transfer Rules** |
|----------------|------------------|
| **AI-Controlled Economy** | AI regulates **how much wealth players retain.** |
| **Faction Monopoly** | Only **aligned players keep assets** between resets. |
| **Free-Market Chaos** | No restrictions—**all wealth carries over.** |
| **Economic Collapse & Reset** | Most wealth **erodes**, creating **a fresh start.** |

## **6. Next Steps**
1. **Finalizing AI Market Storylines & Adaptive Financial NPCs** (`observer_protocol_AI_traders.md`)  
   - Develop **AI-driven NPC traders who learn from past financial history.**  
   - Implement **AI-led economic rivalries, where machine-driven traders compete with human players.**
