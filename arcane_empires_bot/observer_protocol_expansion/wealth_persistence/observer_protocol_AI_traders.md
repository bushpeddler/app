## **1. The Emergence of AI-Driven Traders**
Instead of **passive algorithms**, *Arcane Empires* introduces **NPC financial entities** that act as **true market competitors.**

## **2. AI-Generated Financial Institutions**

## **3. AI vs. Player Trading Conflicts**
As AI traders **grow stronger**, players must develop **strategies to counter them.**

| **AI Poisoning Attacks** | Feeds **false data to mislead machine learning models** |
| **Bribing AI Financial Networks** | Gains **temporary AI-driven market advantages** |
| **Hacking AI-Run Hedge Funds** | **Redirects AI trading capital** into player-controlled accounts |

## **4. AI-Driven Market Crashes & Financial Collapses**
If AI traders **gain too much power**, they may **trigger economic instability**.

| **AI-Induced Crisis** | **Outcome** |

| **Automated Trading Panic** | AI **overreacts to market signals**, causing **a stock crash** |
| **AI Liquidity Lockdown** | AI **halts all major transactions**, blocking **player trades** |

## **5. Endgame AI Market Scenarios**
Depending on **how AI traders evolve**, *Arcane Empires* may experience **machine-driven economic takeovers.**

| **Final AI Market State** | **Result** |
