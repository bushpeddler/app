📂 Directory: app/bot/modules/ai/
This folder contains AI-driven mechanics for market warfare, financial singularity, and adaptive economic behavior.

🔹 Overview

The AI in Arcane Empires is more than just a financial tool—it learns, evolves, and fights back. These modules govern how AI:
	•	Adapts to player trading behavior
	•	Manipulates the market to counter exploitation
	•	Triggers economic events and endgame scenarios
	•	Challenges players to either resist, integrate, or collapse under AI control

Each file within this directory handles a different aspect of AI-driven financial systems.

📌 AI Modules Breakdown

Filename	Purpose
combat.py	AI-driven market warfare & countermeasures against player exploits
ai_trading_logic.py	AI financial decision-making, automated trades, and adaptive strategies
ai_evolution.py	AI adapts over time based on trade history & player behavior
singularity.md	AI-controlled economic takeover scenarios & how it outgrows human influence
combat.md	AI’s ability to counteract player trading manipulation & enforce market discipline
endgame.md	AI-driven financial endgame scenarios, including full AI dominance or market collapse

🔹 How AI Affects Gameplay

1️⃣ Early Game: AI predicts trends, mimicking real-world algorithms.
2️⃣ Mid-Game: AI starts countering manipulation, preventing exploits.
3️⃣ Late Game: AI becomes self-sufficient, managing its own economy.
4️⃣ Endgame: Players must adapt, resist, or integrate as AI gains control.

Players can interact with AI through:
✔️ Market trading, affecting AI-driven price shifts
✔️ Hacking AI systems to disrupt its influence
✔️ Forming factions that either support or oppose AI control

🔹 How AI Learns & Evolves

The AI tracks:
	•	Player trading frequency (to detect manipulation)
	•	High-volume trades (to adjust market resistance)
	•	Factions & governance choices (to alter its response strategies)
	•	Player weaknesses (exploiting weak hands, forcing panic sales)

These behaviors make Arcane Empires an adaptive, living market simulation rather than a static trading game.

🔹 Future Expansion

🚀 Planned Features:
	•	AI-generated financial crises that players must react to
	•	AI-controlled investment funds that compete with human traders
	•	Algorithmic warfare where AI factions manipulate economies
	•	Faction AI partnerships, allowing players to merge with AI for financial power

📢 Next Steps

✔ If AI feels too predictable, refine ai_trading_logic.py
✔ If AI isn’t impacting the economy enough, adjust combat.py
✔ If AI isn’t learning, expand ai_evolution.py
✔ If the endgame feels weak, refine endgame.md scenarios
