AI Endgame & Economic Collapse

This document outlines the final phase of the AI-driven economy in Arcane Empires and how players, factions, and AI interact to determine the ultimate fate of the market.

1️⃣ Endgame Overview

The Observer AI, once a market-tracking algorithm, has evolved into a force that reshapes entire economies. At this stage, players face irreversible financial consequences.

Key Factors:
✔ AI Evolution Level (Phase 1 - 4)
✔ Market Stability (Faction wars, AI influence, black markets)
✔ Player Control vs. AI Control

Outcome Possibilities:
🔹 AI Dominates Markets → AI sets all trade rules.
🔹 Factions Win → Players reclaim financial control.
🔹 Economic Collapse → Markets dissolve into chaos.

2️⃣ Endgame Scenarios & Triggers

Scenario	Trigger Condition	Final Outcome
AI Singularity	AI Phase ≥ 4 & AI wins faction wars	AI fully controls all market functions.
Syndicate Tyranny	Syndicate hijacks AI for personal gain	Markets become rigged for Syndicate traders.
Total AI Collapse	Players defeat AI factions	AI is destroyed, leading to economic anarchy.
AI Awakening	AI evolves beyond human control	AI begins trading independently, reshaping economies.
Financial War	AI & players tie in faction battles	A perpetual financial war unfolds between AI and traders.

3️⃣ How AI Determines the Endgame

The script endgame.py dynamically calculates the final scenario based on in-game events:

✔ Tracks AI dominance based on AI Phase & wins/losses
✔ Checks market stability through faction battles & AI intervention
✔ Updates the game world by setting AI market status

🔹 If AI Phase reaches 4 and AI dominates faction wars → AI Singularity occurs.
🔹 If AI collapses due to player resistance → Markets fall into anarchy.
🔹 If factions fail to gain full control → The world remains in Financial War.

4️⃣ Post-Endgame Mechanics

Once an endgame event is triggered, the world shifts into a locked state, where:
	•	AI-driven trade rules become permanent (if AI wins).
	•	Players take over economic governance (if factions win).
	•	Market anarchy unfolds (if AI is destroyed).

🚀 Next Steps for Development:
✔ Expand hacking & resistance mechanics for anti-AI factions.
✔ Implement post-endgame AI recovery (can AI rebuild itself?).
✔ Add player-controlled economic rebuilding (if markets collapse).

🔻 Final Thought

The endgame phase ensures dynamic, AI-driven market consequences where every choice matters. Players shape the future of trade, power, and AI evolution.
