combat.py - AI Market Warfare & Weak-Handed Player Exploitation

âœ… AI detects and punishes weak-handed traders (low confidence, frequent panic selling).
âœ… Introduces AI-driven market pressure tactics (price shocks, liquidity traps).
âœ… Creates faction-based counterplay options (black-market protection, AI manipulation).
âœ… AI evolves over time, tracking player behavior for future attacks.
