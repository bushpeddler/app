## **1. Multiplayer Market Espionage Mechanics**
Players can **spy on, sabotage, or manipulate rivals** in a **player-driven financial arms race**.

## **3. Faction Strategies for Multiplayer Espionage**
Each faction approaches financial warfare differently:

### **Syndicate: Black Market Manipulation**

- **Flood Observer AI** with **false financial anomalies**, causing targeted **player suspicion**.

### **Technocrats: Algorithm Warfare**
- **Reverse-engineer enemy trading strategies**.
- **Use AI models** to predict **high-value trades before the market shifts**.
- **Hoard financial intelligence**, refusing to sell it on the black market.

### **Rogues: Economic Anarchy**
- **Sell stolen data to the highest bidder**.
- **Corrupt the Observer Protocol**, wiping **entire financial histories**.
- **Destroy centralized market stability**, creating **chaotic price fluctuations**.
