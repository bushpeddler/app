README: Engine Modules

📂 Directory: app/bot/modules/market/engine/
This folder contains the core logic for market operations, faction-based economy manipulation, and AI-driven financial mechanics in Arcane Empires.

🛠️ Overview

The engine modules handle:
✅ Market updates & AI-driven fluctuations
✅ Faction-based market influence
✅ Dynamic price shifts based on trade activity
✅ Logging & debugging for economic simulations

Each file within this directory plays a specific role in ensuring that market conditions are dynamic, AI-responsive, and faction-driven.

📌 File Breakdown

File	Purpose
engine.py	The primary market engine responsible for price updates, AI trades, and player-driven economy shifts.
factions.py	Governs faction-based economic manipulation, ensuring factions can influence asset values and market control.

🔧 Market Engine Functionality

The engine.py module controls:
	•	📈 Price Fluctuations → Stocks randomly adjust based on AI & faction activity.
	•	📊 Trade Impact → Large transactions alter stock prices dynamically.
	•	⚙️ Market Events → AI interventions, economic crashes, and volatility cycles.

	🔹 This engine will evolve over time as additional AI mechanics and economic behaviors are introduced.

🏴 Faction Economic Warfare

The factions.py module ensures:
	•	Factions can control or sabotage markets.
	•	Market conditions change based on faction power.
	•	Players can manipulate stocks through faction actions.

	🔹 Future expansions may introduce faction-led economic policies, trade embargoes, and market coups.

📌 Future Enhancements

🔹 AI Trading Bot → Smarter AI-driven market behaviors
🔹 Automated Stock Buyouts → AI can attempt hostile takeovers
🔹 Faction Market Strategies → More complex faction-based economy systems

This system will grow over time to support deeper financial mechanics, AI trading, and player-controlled market manipulation.
