## 🔧 **How It Works**
### 📈 1️⃣ **Stock Market Simulation**
- The system **updates stock prices dynamically** based on **random market fluctuations** and **player trades**.
- Uses **configurable volatility ranges** for stock price adjustments.
- **AI can manipulate prices** through event-driven triggers.

### 💹 2️⃣ **AI Trading & Economic Events**
- **AI adapts to player behavior**, adjusting market conditions.
- **Faction interactions** affect stock values:
  - Cyber Syndicate boosts digital stocks 💾
  - Shadow Brokers cause economic instability 🕵️

### 🔄 3️⃣ **Admin Tools & Debugging**
- **Market Reset**: Admins can reset all stocks to baseline values.
- **Event Simulation**: Can trigger economic booms, crashes, or sabotage.

## 🔨 **Installation & Setup**
### 📌 1️⃣ **Dependencies**
Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

📌 2️⃣ Database Setup

The Market Engine uses SQLite. Ensure the database is initialized:

python bot/database/init_db.py

Check if the market table exists:

sqlite3 observer_protocol.db
.tables

If missing, manually create:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS market (
    stock TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    price INTEGER
);
INSERT INTO market (stock, price) VALUES ('Quantum Energy', 100);

🎮 Usage

Run the market system manually for testing:

python bot/market/engine.py

✅ Expected Output:

{
    "Quantum Energy": 120,
    "NeoTech AI": 175,
    "Cyber Credits": 200,
    "Shadow Bank": 165,
    "Arcane Bonds": 140
}

🏛 Faction-Based Market Manipulation

Trigger a faction-based influence event:

from market.engine import apply_faction_influence

apply_faction_influence("Cyber Syndicate", "Boost Digital Assets")

Expected Market Reaction:
	•	Digital stocks increase by 10%
	•	Cyber Credits & NeoTech AI surge in price

🛠 Troubleshooting

❌ Market Prices Not Updating?
	•	Ensure the database path is correct in engine.py:

DB_PATH = "/workspaces/app/observer_protocol.db"



❌ AI Trades Not Triggering?
	•	Check that ai_trades() is called inside the main loop.
	•	Verify the trade history exists in the database:

SELECT * FROM trade_history ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;



❌ Faction Effects Not Working?
	•	Ensure faction_engine.py is properly imported:

from market.faction_engine import apply_faction_influence
