📌 Notes on fake_orders.py

	Purpose: Implements AI-driven fake buy/sell orders to manipulate player behavior in the market.

1️⃣ Overview

AI uses false market signals to trick players into making poor trading decisions.

✅ Fake Buy Orders → AI creates artificial demand, making traders think a stock is rising.
✅ Fake Sell Orders → AI creates panic selling, causing traders to dump assets irrationally.

2️⃣ Key Mechanics

Mechanism	Effect on Market
Fake Buy Orders	Players see high buy volumes, assuming a stock is rising.
Fake Sell Orders	Players see massive sell-offs, triggering fear-based selling.
Market Confusion	False trades make it harder to determine real vs. AI-generated trends.

3️⃣ AI Order Logic
	•	AI chooses a random stock from key assets.
	•	50% chance of generating BUY or SELL fake orders.
	•	Order volume is randomized between 100 - 500 shares.
	•	Fake orders are logged into the database but don’t actually execute real transactions.

4️⃣ Interaction with Other Market Mechanics
	•	Fake orders can be detected by scam_countermeasures.py (if the player invested in scam protection).
	•	They are separate from Pump-and-Dump mechanics but can be combined for advanced AI deception.
	•	Observer AI may intervene if players over-exploit fake orders to gain an advantage.

5️⃣ Future Enhancements

🔹 AI Adapts to Player Reactions → If players detect fake orders too easily, AI can change tactics.
🔹 Player Tools for Scam Detection → Players may unlock financial algorithms that expose fake orders.
🔹 Factions Use Fake Orders for Market Warfare → Some factions may deploy their own fake orders to manipulate rival economies.

✅ Why This Matters

✔ Adds market uncertainty → Players cannot trust all trade signals.
✔ Creates AI-driven market deception → Encourages players to analyze trades carefully.
✔ Expands scam mechanics → Works alongside Pump-and-Dump schemes for deeper AI strategy.

This setup makes fake_orders.py a critical tool in AI-driven financial manipulation. 🚀
