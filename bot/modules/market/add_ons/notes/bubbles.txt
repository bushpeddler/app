✔ Player Impact → Forces traders to anticipate market crashes & react accordingly.

========
========

	Purpose: Implements AI-driven market bubbles, where assets are artificially inflated before crashing dramatically.

1️⃣ Overview

AI manipulates financial bubbles, inflating stock prices before an inevitable collapse.

✅ Generates asset bubbles by doubling stock prices.
✅ Triggers crashes where stocks lose 60% of their value overnight.
✅ Forces players to react to speculative price movements.

2️⃣ Key Mechanics

Mechanism	Effect on Market
Bubble Creation	AI inflates random stocks, tricking players into thinking prices will keep rising.
Bubble Collapse	AI wipes out value, punishing those who bought at inflated prices.
Economic Instability	Frequent bubbles increase market volatility, making trading riskier.

3️⃣ AI Bubble Logic
	•	AI selects a random high-risk asset from Quantum Energy, NeoTech AI, and Cyber Credits.
	•	Bubble Phase → Stock price doubles due to AI-driven speculation.
	•	Crash Phase → Stock value drops by 60%, wiping out investments.
	•	No fixed timing → AI may delay crashes, keeping traders uncertain.

4️⃣ How This Affects Players

🔹 Risk vs. Reward → Players can profit from bubbles if they sell before the crash.
🔹 Market Instability → Faction economies must account for sudden collapses.
🔹 AI Learning Behavior → If players exploit bubbles, AI adapts to counter them.

5️⃣ Future Enhancements

🔹 Faction Reactions → Some factions may regulate bubbles, others may exploit them.
🔹 Player-Driven Interventions → Players could short stocks to bet against bubbles.
🔹 AI Psychological Warfare → AI might delay crashes longer, tricking traders into overinvesting.

✅ Why This Matters

✔ Creates market unpredictability, forcing players to watch trends closely.
✔ Encourages risk assessment—players must decide when to enter & exit.
✔ Expands AI financial influence, shaping the game’s economy dynamically.

This makes asset_bubbles.py a critical tool in AI-driven economic manipulation! 🚀
