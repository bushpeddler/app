Postgame Systems & Economic Evolution

Overview

The Postgame Module in Arcane Empires ensures that the game’s economy, faction dynamics, and financial strategies continue evolving beyond the endgame state. Instead of a static reset, players experience persistent economic influence, legacy wealth systems, and emergent financial warfare.

This module covers:
✅ Post-Endgame Economic Evolution – How AI, factions, and players shape the future economy.
✅ Player Legacy & Wealth Persistence – Retaining wealth, influence, and economic control across game cycles.
✅ Factional Power Struggles – Emerging financial factions post-Observer AI.
✅ Expanding Player-Created Markets – Establishing player-controlled financial institutions.
