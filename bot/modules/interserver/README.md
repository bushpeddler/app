Interserver Economy & Market Synchronization

	Folder: app/bot/modules/interserver/
Purpose: Enables cross-server economic interactions, global trade synchronization, and AI-driven financial interventions.

📌 Overview

The Interserver Module expands Arcane Empires by allowing:
✅ Cross-server trading – Players can transfer assets between different game instances.
✅ Global economy synchronization – Market fluctuations affect all connected servers.
✅ AI-driven financial disruptions – AI factions can manipulate cross-server markets.
✅ Interserver financial warfare – Factions compete for economic dominance across servers.

This module consists of two .md documents for strategy and execution, plus a Python script that handles real-time interserver transactions.

📂 Folder Structure

📁 interserver/ 
   ├── 📄 interserver_economy.md   # Strategy guide on cross-server financial interactions.

📑 File Descriptions
	•	interserver_economy.md – Explains multi-server economy mechanics, trade routes, and AI influence.
	•	interserver_logic.md – Documents how interserver_logic.py executes cross-server synchronization.
	•	interserver_logic.py – Implements market syncing, AI trade intervention, and interserver financial warfare.

📌 Key Features

1️⃣ Cross-Server Market Mechanics
	•	Players and AI can buy/sell assets across different servers.
	•	Certain resources are server-exclusive, creating regional pricing variations.
	•	Market fluctuations occur based on interserver trade volume.

2️⃣ AI-Driven Trade Disruptions
	•	Observer AI detects and adjusts high-risk interserver trades.
	•	AI can restrict liquidity, alter pricing, or introduce artificial stock shortages.
	•	Rogue AI entities may destabilize entire interserver trade networks.

3️⃣ Economic Warfare Between Servers

Tactic	Effect on Economy
Trade Embargo	A faction prevents specific assets from leaving a server.
Liquidity Sabotage	AI manipulates prices, causing artificial market crashes.
Market Takeover	A faction monopolizes interserver trade, dictating asset values.
AI Rogue Operations	AI-driven markets create self-sustaining financial loops.

⚙️ How interserver_logic.py Works
	•	sync_market_data() → Pulls live trade data from connected servers.
	•	execute_trade() → Handles cross-server transactions securely.
	•	ai_intervention() → Observer AI detects and reacts to economic manipulation.
	•	log_transaction() → Records all interserver trade history for analysis.

🚀 Future Enhancements

🔹 Player-Controlled Market Syndicates → Factions can form interserver trade alliances.
🔹 Server-Specific Market Events → AI triggers unexpected economic shifts across multiple servers.
🔹 Decentralized Interserver Governance → Players vote on global trade policies affecting all game instances.

✅ Next Steps

✔ Ensure interserver_logic.py properly synchronizes with external market servers.
✔ Test AI trade interventions to balance cross-server economy fluctuations.
✔ Expand player influence by adding faction-based economic warfare mechanics.
