# **Interserver Economy & Market Synchronization**
> **Module: `interserver_logic.py`**  
> **Purpose:** Enables **cross-server** economic interactions, market influence, and AI-driven financial conflicts.

## **1️⃣ Overview**
The **Interserver Economy System** allows:
✅ **Cross-server trading** (players can move assets between servers).  
✅ **Global market synchronization** (server economies impact one another).  
✅ **AI-controlled economic sabotage & interventions** (factions & AI influence multiple markets).  
✅ **Server-based economic warfare** (factions create economic alliances or sabotage competitors).

## **2️⃣ Core Features**
### **📌 A. Interserver Trade Mechanics**
- **Players & AI** can buy/sell assets across different game instances.
- Unique **"server-exclusive assets"** exist, creating **regional market variations**.
- Prices adjust dynamically **based on global supply & demand**.

### **📌 B. AI-Driven Market Influence**
- Observer AI **monitors interserver transactions** and can **restrict** or **expand** trade routes.
- Rogue AI systems may **destabilize markets** by generating **synthetic liquidity traps**.
- AI factions can **collaborate or compete** with human traders.

### **📌 C. Interserver Economic Warfare**
| **Tactic** | **Effect** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Trade Embargo** | A server blocks resources from being exported. |
| **Financial Sabotage** | AI or factions manipulate prices, causing crashes. |
| **Market Takeover** | A faction dominates interserver trade routes. |
| **AI Economic Disruptions** | AI-controlled trade routes bypass player influence. |
