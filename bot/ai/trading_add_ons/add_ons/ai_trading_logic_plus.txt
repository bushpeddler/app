This file explains how AI trading works and what features are planned.

# AI Market Engine (Advanced Version)

## 📌 Overview
This script is the **first step** toward a **fully autonomous AI market system**.  
The AI **monitors stock trends**, **trades dynamically**, and **flags suspicious price changes**.

## 🔹 Features
- **AI Trading Profiles**: Conservative, Balanced, Aggressive.
- **Bull/Bear Market Cycles**: AI adjusts risk based on market conditions.
- **Stock Trend Analysis**: AI evaluates short-term uptrends and downtrends.
- **Market Exploit Detection**: Detects rapid price shifts and flags for review.

## 🔹 How AI Makes Decisions
| AI Profile  | Buy Chance | Sell Chance | Risk Tolerance |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Conservative | 30% | 70% | Low |
| Balanced | 50% | 50% | Medium |
| Aggressive | 70% | 30% | High |

- In a **Bull Market**, AI is **aggressive** and trades frequently.
- In a **Bear Market**, AI is **cautious** and sells more often.

## 🔹 Future Features
✅ **AI Learning from Players**: AI remembers past trades and reacts.  
✅ **Market Sentiment Analysis**: AI reads in-game news events.  
✅ **Faction-Based Economic Warfare**: AI influences different factions.  
✅ **Dynamic Stock Inflation & Crashes**: AI reacts to major game events.  

## 🔹 How to Use
Run the AI trading system manually:

```bash
python ai_market_engine.py

To integrate it into the game loop, call:

from game.ai_systems.trading_logic import ai_market_update
ai_market_update()

⏭️ Next Steps
	•	This lays the groundwork for AI learning and market adaptation.
	•	Later, we plug in memory-based AI behaviors so AI can respond to player decisions over time.
	•	Once AI tracks player transactions, we enable counter-strategies & deeper trading mechanics.

🔹 Is This a Good Starting Point?

This doesn’t require AI learning yet, but prepares the framework for:
1️⃣ AI reacting to player trades.
2️⃣ AI shaping the market dynamically.
3️⃣ AI preventing exploits & manipulation.
