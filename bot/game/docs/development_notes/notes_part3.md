✅ Organized & Structured Notes for Arcane Empires (Expanded & Sorted)

I’ve structured the remaining notes into organized sections, ensuring clarity and completeness.

These notes include new mechanics, game logic, faction-based trading, AI morality, deployment, and more.

📜 1. Game Logic System

🔹 Game Logic Module

📂 File: GAME_LOGIC_README.md
📌 Purpose: Controls core player actions including trading, hacking AI, and joining factions.

📌 Core Functions

Function	Purpose
trade(player_id, stock, amount)	Executes a trade by checking stock prices, verifying funds, updating wealth, and recording transactions.
hack_ai(player_id)	Simulates a hacking attempt on Observer AI. Success grants advantages, failure locks market access.
join_faction(player_id, faction)	Updates faction affiliation in the database.

✅ Interacts with:
✔ market_engine.py → Updates stock prices post-trade.
✔ faction_system.py → Modifies faction-based effects.

✅ Database Requirements:
✔ Tables Needed: players, market, trade_history, factions.

✅ Randomized Mechanics:
✔ hack_ai() → Uses random success/failure outcomes.

📜 2. Web Dashboard & Live Updates

📂 Folder: /web_dashboard/
📌 Purpose: Displays live stock data, player rankings, and faction stats.

✅ What It Includes
✔ Stock Prices 📈 (Bar Chart)
✔ Top Players 💰 (Leaderboard)
✔ Faction Influence 🏴 (Pie Chart)

📌 Steps to Run

📜 5. AI Morality System

📌 Purpose: Defines AI ethical alignments that influence the market.

✅ How AI Morality Works
✔ AI tracks market events (trades, crises, faction conflicts).
✔ AI adjusts its behavior dynamically based on market trends.
✔ AI shifts between different morality alignments.

📌 AI Morality Alignments

Benevolent AI	Ensures fair wealth distribution.	Prevents extreme crashes, helps struggling traders.
Neutral AI	Operates purely on efficiency.	Trades based on statistics, with no bias.
Exploitative AI	Maximizes profits ruthlessly.	Creates price manipulation, exploits trader mistakes.
Faction-Aligned AI	Picks a faction to favor.	Skews the market toward one faction.

✅ New Commands
