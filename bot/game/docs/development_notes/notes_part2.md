Below is a clean, structured version of your notes, grouped into relevant categories with clear explanations.
This version ensures better readability and logical order, preserving all details.

📜 1. AI Trading System

🔹 AI Trading Logic Module

📂 File: AI_TRADING_LOGIC_README.md
📌 Purpose: Controls AI-driven stock market behavior based on the AI’s morality stance.

Core Features
	•	Market Fluctuations: The AI adjusts stock prices dynamically based on its morality.
	•	Morality-Based Trading: Uses ai_morality.AI_MORALITY_TYPES to decide how stocks change.
	•	Database Integration: Stores AI morality & market data in observer_protocol.db.

Core Functionality

Function	Purpose
ai_trade_decision()	Adjusts stock prices based on AI’s morality setting.
get_ai_morality()	Retrieves AI morality from the global_state table.
apply_market_behavior()	Updates stock prices based on morality-driven logic.

Requirements

✅ Database Tables:
	•	global_state: Stores ai_morality value.
	•	market: Contains stock & price columns.

✅ Dependencies:
	•	ai_morality.py: Defines AI morality states & market behaviors.

📌 Additional Notes
	•	Error Handling: Handles missing/undefined AI morality cases.
	•	Context Management: Uses with statements to safely handle SQLite connections.

📜 2. Game & Market Engines

🔹 Overview

📂 Branch: arcane-empires-engines-refactor
📌 Purpose: Separates core game logic and market simulation into modular files.

📌 File Structure

.
├── game_engine.py        # Handles game events & progression
└── market_engine.py      # Manages stock market fluctuations

📌 Core Components

1️⃣ Game Engine (game_engine.py)

📌 Purpose: Runs the main game loop, unlocking content based on player progress.

✅ Functions:

Function	Purpose
game_tick(player_id)	Checks progression & triggers random game events.
trigger_event()	Activates market crashes, faction battles, or AI upgrades.

✅ Integrated Modules:
	•	unlock_system.py
	•	market_scam.py
	•	black_market.py
	•	ai_morality.py

2️⃣ Market Engine (market_engine.py)

📌 Purpose: Simulates AI-driven stock market behavior with faction influence.

✅ Functions:

Function	Purpose
get_market_status()	Retrieves live stock prices.
update_market()	Simulates price fluctuations & faction manipulation.
ai_trades()	AI adjusts stock prices based on player trades.

✅ Market Behavior Types
	•	Basic: Random price fluctuations.
	•	Faction-Influenced: Stocks change based on player factions.
	•	AI-Driven: AI reacts to trading patterns for dynamic pricing.

📜 3. Event Systems

🔹 Overview

📂 Branch: arcane-empires-engines-readme
📌 Purpose: Splits events into different files for better organization.

📌 Event Modules

1️⃣ Market Collapse Events (event_system_collapse.py)

📌 Purpose:
	•	📉 Severe crashes in response to AI failure or large sell-offs.
	•	🏛 Endgame scenario integration (massive market shifts).

✅ Events Triggered
	•	Market Collapse: -40% stock value.
	•	AI Lockdown: -10% stock value.
	•	Hyperinflation: Triggers endgame.
	•	Faction War: Increases ‘Shadow Bank’ by 20%.

2️⃣ Sabotage Events (event_system_sabotage.py)

📌 Purpose:
	•	🔥 Targeted attacks on the economy.
	•	🏴 Faction-led sabotage disrupting specific stocks.

✅ Events Triggered
	•	AI Market Crash: -30% stock value.
	•	Syndicate Surge: +50% ‘Quantum Energy’.
	•	AI Overload: +10 credits for ‘NeoTech AI’.
	•	Faction War: Political conflict (no direct market impact).

✅ Best Practices
✔ Uses SQLite context managers (with) for safe database interactions.
✔ Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
✔ Modular design allows events to be independently triggered.

📜 4. Faction Systems

	•	Uses governance_policies table in observer_protocol.db.

🔹 Faction System Module

📂 File: FACTION_SYSTEM_README.md
📌 Purpose: Allows factions to manipulate market trends.

📌 Core Features
