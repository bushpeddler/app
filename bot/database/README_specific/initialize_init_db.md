What Was Updated?

✅ Fixes missing connection pass (conn) in init_players_table()
✅ Ensures all tables are created in sequence to prevent dependency issues
✅ Adds conn.commit() to prevent data loss during setup
✅ Logs the database setup progress for debugging

🔹 Next Steps

1️⃣ Replace the old init_db.py with this updated version.
2️⃣ Run the script in Textastic (or wherever you’re testing your code):

python init_db.py

3️⃣ Confirm that the database initializes correctly and that all tables exist.

sqlite3 observer_protocol.db
.tables  # Should list all tables

4️⃣ If .tables lists everything correctly, your database is fully set up! 🚀
