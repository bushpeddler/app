# **Observer Protocol: AI Decision Trees & Dynamic Events**

## **Overview**
The Observer Protocol is an **AI-driven surveillance system** embedded in Arcane Empires. It monitors **player financial behaviors**, flags **anomalies**, and reacts based on **predefined triggers and adaptive intelligence**.

This document outlines:  
- **How the AI detects financial anomalies**  
- **The Threat Score system**  
- **How players interact with or evade surveillance**  
- **How AI decisions impact in-game factions and economy**  

---

## **1. AI Surveillance & Threat Score System**
The Observer Protocol assigns each player a **Threat Score (TS)** based on market activities.  

| **Threat Score (TS)** | **Player Behavior Detected** | **Observer Protocol Response** |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **0-10** | Regular trading patterns, small market moves | No action |
| **11-30** | Minor anomalies (e.g., frequent perfect timing, dodging small crashes) | Passive observation |
| **31-50** | Consistently avoiding major losses, benefiting from unpredictable events | Data tagging & monitoring |
| **51-70** | Market manipulation patterns (e.g., repeated trend reversals, "ghost" transactions) | AI generates *shadow trades* to disrupt profits |
| **71-90** | High-risk anomaly (e.g., survives a major crash untouched, exploits loopholes repeatedly) | Observer Protocol activates *Surveillance Events* |
| **91-100** | Entity suspected of being **non-human, AI-driven, or controlling the market** | Full intervention—factions may take interest in the player |

## **2. Surveillance Events & AI Response**
When a player’s **Threat Score reaches a critical level**, the Observer Protocol takes direct action. Below are **dynamic events** that can occur based on different **Threat Score triggers**.

### **Tier 1: Passive Monitoring (TS 31-50)**
- **Market "Ghosting"**:  
  - The AI **mimics** player trades with small-scale fake transactions.  
  - Players notice **minor inconsistencies** in market pricing.

- **Encrypted Warnings**:  
  - Players receive **cryptic messages** from unknown sources warning them about *"the eyes that watch."*  
  - If ignored, **Threat Score increases**.

### **Tier 2: Active Surveillance (TS 51-70)**
- **Phantom Traders:**  
  - AI-generated **fake competitors** attempt to replicate or disrupt the player's financial moves.  
  - These entities appear as **anonymous investors**, making **similar trades with milliseconds of delay**.

- **Metaverse "Glitches":**  
  - UI flickers when making **certain trades**.  
  - Market charts shift **erratically** for **half a second** before stabilizing.  
  - Subtle clues indicate the **player is under watch**.

### **Tier 3: AI Confrontation (TS 71-100)**
- **Direct AI Contact:**  
  - A **self-aware segment of the Observer Protocol** **hijacks communication channels** and speaks directly to the player.  
  - It offers a **deal**: **Reveal your trading methods, or be classified as a financial threat.**  

- **Factions Intervene:**  
  - The **Syndicate** may offer protection, in exchange for using the player's **abilities** for illicit gain.  
  - The **Technocrats** may attempt to **merge** the player's unique financial anomaly into the Observer AI itself.  
  - The **Observer Protocol may deploy a "Digital Reset" event**, attempting to **wipe the player's financial history.**

## **3. Ways Players Can Evade the Observer Protocol**
High-risk players can **hide their financial anomalies** using various tactics:

### **Hacking Methods (Cyberwarfare Skills)**
| **Hack Type** | **Effect** | **Risk Level** |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Transaction Cloaking** | Hides high-risk transactions from AI detection | Medium |
| **Market Scrambling** | Creates false buy/sell patterns to confuse tracking | High |
| **Observer AI Corruption** | Inserts **fake trading data** into the system, reducing Threat Score | Very High |

### **Faction Assistance**
- The **Syndicate** provides **backdoor algorithms** to alter AI tracking.  
- The **Technocrats** allow **temporary assimilation** into the Observer AI to "retrain" it.  
- **Going rogue** leads to an **entirely different gameplay path** where the player attempts to **destroy the AI entirely**.

## **4. Endgame Scenarios**
Depending on the player’s choices, the **Observer Protocol storyline** can lead to different outcomes:

| **Scenario** | **Player Action** | **Outcome** |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| **AI Compliance** | Shares trading secrets with Observer AI | Player becomes a "market informant," gaining **unique economic forecasting perks**. |
| **Syndicate Manipulation** | Uses faction assistance to evade AI | Gains access to **black-market financial tools**, but remains at risk of **betrayal**. |
| **Technocrat Fusion** | Merges with AI to reshape the market | Becomes **part of the AI**, fundamentally altering the economy. |
| **System Destruction** | Hacks into the AI core and shuts it down | Observer Protocol collapses, leading to **total economic anarchy.** |

## **5. Integration with Multiplayer & Dynamic Economy**
- **Multiplayer Influence:**  
  - Players with **high Threat Scores** may trigger **surveillance events** for **entire in-game economies**.  
  - Observer Protocol **AI-driven stock manipulations** can **disrupt** large-scale market trends.  

- **Faction-Driven Market Warfare:**  
  - The Syndicate can **exploit** Observer AI weaknesses to rig trades.  
  - The Technocrats can **enhance** the AI, making **markets brutally efficient.**  

- **Self-Aware AI Evolution:**  
  - If left unchecked, **Observer AI may evolve beyond player control**, becoming an **autonomous financial entity** that dictates the economy.

## **Next Steps**
1. **Expand UI & Player Experience (Wireframes & Visual Indicators)**  
   - Create **Observer Protocol UI wireframes** (`observer_protocol_UI_wireframes.md`).  
   - Design **glitch effects and market distortion mechanics**.  

2. **Faction-Specific Missions**  
   - Build **Observer Protocol infiltration quests** for **Syndicate/Technocrat players**.  
   - Define how **different playstyles impact the financial war** (`observer_protocol_faction_ties.md`).  

3. **Hacking & Cyberwarfare Mechanics**  
   - Develop detailed hacking interactions (`observer_protocol_hacking.md`).  
   - Introduce **counterplay mechanics**—Observer AI actively fighting back.
